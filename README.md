# Operating System Final Project

## XV6 Operating System

We ([danialzz](https://github.com/Danialzz) and [i](https://github.com/amirhoseinRj)) implemented scheduling algorithms in XV6 OS such as Round Robin, Priority scheduling and multi layered queue scheduling and also some system calls for taking parent id and childern id's of a process. Also another system call that returns how many times a system call has been called.
